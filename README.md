# Blackjack_RL

Repository is used for tracking my Reinforcement Learning model for Blackjack gameplay

Will contain training notebook, gameplay scripts, and saved trained Q-learning model

Eventually, I'd like to create a UI in React (potentially coupled with a Flask backend), to simulate Blackjack gameplay, displaying optimal moves at each turn.
