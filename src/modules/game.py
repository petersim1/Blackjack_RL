"""
This module controls the blackjack gameplay.
It wraps the Player module, which represents each player and the house,
and uses Cards for the shoe

Input :
    - player_module : class , uninitialized Player module from Player.py
    - shrink_deck : boolean , whether or not to remove selected cards from deck. If False, each card is drawn iid.
    - n_decks : number of decks to play with (default is 6, which is typical)
    - ratio_penetrate : ratio of cards that are playable (default is 2/3 of 6 decks). Only applicable when shrinkDeck == True.
    
MUST call init_round() to start the round

For the house, the first card is shown, the second card is hidden.
